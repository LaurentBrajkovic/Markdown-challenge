## You can always count on me when...

There is a need to find a janky yet functionnal solution 5 minutes before the deadline...  
Or avoiding reaching that point alltogether should you have considered my options when the assignement started :)  
Also i usually bring food...

## One day in my native Croatian village
I saw my grandfather sitting still on a bench, staring into the vast distance of the motherland.  
Being bored and carving social interaction i sat on his left. </br> He broke the silence by claiming. </br>    "**Never** compliment a woman on her moustache".</br>  Flabbergasted i looked at him in awe, about to utter some words when he turned back to me dramatically and insisted with a right black eye. </br> "**No matter** how gorgeous it is".

### TLDR
Never compliment a woman on her moustache </br>
...</br>
No matter how gorgeous it is...
